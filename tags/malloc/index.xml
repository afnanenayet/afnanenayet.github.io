      <description>A lot of people have trouble grasping manual memory management when they first encounter it. The syntax can be a little confusing and debugging can be an extremely painful process - whether you have a segfault or Valgrind is complaining that you still have memory leaks.
Using pointers in C, while a little intimidating at first, is not as difficult as most people expect.
C gives you a lot of access to memory - you can allocate bytes for use in your program, you can deallocate them, you can directly access memory addresses in your program, and pass them around wherever you want.</description>
