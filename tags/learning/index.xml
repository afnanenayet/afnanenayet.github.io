      <description>We will examine an unlabeled dataset of recorded data about livers that are believed to be indicative of liver disorders/liver disease, as well as the frequency of drinks per day per person to create a model. We will use K-means clustering to find interesting groups/clusters within the dataset. We will also use cross validation and ensemble learning to fine-tune the model.
Exploring the data We will examine the traits of the liver dataset so we can understand the relationships in the data and understand the shape of the dataset.</description>

      <description>A classic statistics problem In machine learning, problems are often framed as optimization problems. For example, let us take one of the simplest applications of supervised learning: the linear regression. It&#39;s conceptually an easy problem - given a set of data points, create a function \( f = ax + b \) that best approximates these points. If you ever took statistics or have used excel, this is the line of best fit.</description>
